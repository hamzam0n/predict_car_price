# predict_car_price

## The project objective

Our project is based on the idea that someone may think of setting a new automotive
company in the US market for example with a manufacturing unit there and cars produc-
tion locally but of course, he has to think twice before jumping seen the huge competition
from US and European counterparts.

So the first step of this project will be the market analyze and for that reason, we need
to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, the factors
affecting the price in the American market, since those may be very different depending
on each country. The company should know :
  * Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
  * How will those variables describe the price of a car Based on various market surveys.
  
the company should start with dataset collection of different types of cars across
the American market. Then based on that, a model will be required to model the price
of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management
to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can
accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain
price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the
pricing dynamics of a new market.

So our objective is to use linear regression model using car price assignment dataset.
We want to know the relationship among variables, especially between the car prices with
other variables. We also want to predict the price of a new car based on the historical
data.
